Assignment tools: postgres, excel (or some other tool for visualization)

Motivation: In this homework you will implement a basic data analysis pipeline: data acquisition, transformation and extraction, cleaning, analysis and sharing of results. The data is [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/), the reference citation website created and maintained by Michael Ley. 

**Resources:**

1. postgres, MYSQL, or SQLLite
2. starter code


## **Problem 1: Conceptual Design**

Design and create a database schema about publications. We will refer to this schema as **PubSchema**, and to the data as **PubData**. 

E/R Diagram. Design the E/R diagram, consisting of the entity sets and relationships below. Draw the E/R diagram for this schema, identify all keys in all entity sets, and indicate the correct type of all relationships (many-many or many-one); make sure you use the ISA box where needed.

1. Author has attributes: id (a key; must be unique), name, and homepage (a URL)
2. Publication has attributes: pubid (the key -- an integer), pubkey (an alternative key, text; must be unique), title, and year. It has the following subclasses: \
  a. Article has additional attributes: journal, month, volume, number \
  b. Book has additional attributes: publisher, isbn \
  c. Incollection has additional attributes: booktitle, publisher, isbn \
  d. Inproceedings has additional attributes: booktitle, editor 
3. There is a many-many relationship Authored from Author to Publication
